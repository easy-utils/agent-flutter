# Agent chat app (Flutter)

A minimal two-pane agent chat app talking **directly to the abc agent backend**
over `agent.v1.AgentService` via Connect (HTTP/2 over TLS). It has only two
areas: a **session list** and a **chat view with a settings bar** (model/preset
switch + interrupt/compact). No abcp gateway, no REST.

Powered by `agent_client_sdk` (agent-sdk-dart), generated from
`agent/v1/agent.proto`.

## Run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

On launch, enter the agent base URL (`https://...`) + bearer token in Settings.
